# ðŸŽ¹ `synth`

A tool that simulates a monorepo in a polyrepo world, while allowing local
patches/modifications that are not present in upstream repos. `synth` assumes a
reasonably modern version of `git` is available in the user's `PATH`.

## Commands

* `synth init`

    Initialize a new `synth` repository.

* `synth add <origin> [--ref=<ref>] [--name=<name>]`

    Track the repository at `<origin>` at its current `HEAD` (unless an
    alternative `<ref>` is specified) as one of the modules of this monorepo.
    By default, the stem of `<origin>` is used as the name of this module. This
    can be overriden by specifying a `<name>`.

    A `<name>` must be specified if a module already exists with the inferred
    `<name>`.

* `synth compose [<name>...] [<target>]`

    Compose a directory structure at `<target>` from the constitutents of this
    monorepo, applying any patches that were extracted (see `synth extract`)
    earlier.

    If `<name>`s are specified, only compose those constituents, otherwise
    compose all constitutents.

* `synth extract [<name>...] [<target>] [--upstream=<upstream>]`

    Extract any modifications to all the modules at `<target>` from an upstream
    ref to the current `HEAD` into a patch series tracked within this `synth`
    repo.  By default, `@{upstream}` is used but this can be overriden on the
    commandline.

    If `<name>`s are specified, only extract those constituents, otherwise
    extract all constitutents.

* `synth config <property> <value>`

    Update this repository's configuration file to set the `<property>` to
    `<value>`. The following properties are supported:

    * `target.path`

        Set the default `<target>` path for the `compose` and `extract`
        subcommands, making that argument optional.
